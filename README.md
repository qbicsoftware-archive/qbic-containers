# A central repository for containerized applications used at QBIC




## Documentation

The container scripts/recipes are structured in a way that we have a Docker folder and a Singularity folder in here.

Mandatory are:

- a single folder per tool
- a subfolder per specific tool version

Mostly, we're trying to follow biocontainers and use bioconda to install packages in a well-structured way.  

More up to date documentation will follow very soon.
